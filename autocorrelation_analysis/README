"ttpackage" is a (rather old) standalone program to analyze timeseries data
for autocorrelations.

Executable linux-pc files are tt_pc_opt_long and tt_pc_opt_long_dbl.

It works interactively (or with a prepared input file),
reading data from a specified file.
Data: One line per timestep, with measurements of one or several different quantities.
The data format can be specified interactively.

Output: Mainly autocorrelation analysis, printed on standard output.
        (Optional: timeseries, histogram)

Plots can also be produced, especially of the autocorrelation functions and
their fits, producing several estimates of integrated and exponential autocorrelation times.

They go to file "fort.3" in human readable "topdrawer" input format.
(Ancient package, similar to gnuplot...)
The text printed in those plots is similar to that printed on standard output.
An example containing 2 autocorrelation functions is provided.

It is often worthwhile to look at the autocorrelation functions.
As a work-around, the actual autocorrelation data can be extracted with a text editor and fed
into gnuplot (Exponential like "D-02" may have to be changed to "E-02")
