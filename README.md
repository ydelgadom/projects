projects
========

Main projects during my PhD and postdoc at the University of Graz

This repository contains:

- Autocorrelation analysis programs (code by Hans Gerd Evertz)
- Z(3) spin model: MC program (worm algorithm) and analysis program
- SU(3) spin model: MC program (Metropolis algorithm) and analysis program
- Gauge-Higgs models (Z(3) and U(1)): MC program (surface worm algorithm) and analysis program

Apart from the code, I added all the published articles related to projects.
